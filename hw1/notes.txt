-wish i remembered the 'let' syntax... thought i don't know if i would have used it, i would have liked to compare it to the single-line function definitions that i came up with... some of them "felt" a little too long
-i kept confusing $ and . -- i'll have to do some more work 
- sumDigits implemented in "point-free" style .. i think
- used more parens than i recall seeing in other haskell code... something to look into
- i find it interesting that the hanoi function doesn't move the pegs themselves but produces a list of moves
